## INTRODUCTION

Ever realize that you and your friends just don't have the time to plan out events and things to do together? Well the goal of this project was to share a social calendar with friends, to see when and what everyone was busy and up to.

**The Hoot App**

Is a social calendar application meant to allow many users to set up events and share them with others in a centralized location.

## TECHNOLOGY USED

- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- HBS
- Heroku
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose

## APPROACH

There were lots of moving pieces, namely the data Schema, full CRUD functionality, and UI. I wanted to make sure I had a thorough plan before jumping into the code.

- Once my routes had been developed, I needed to add CRUD functionality to them.
- My focus was on getting the data seeded and added, then to have them display visually on the front end.
- From there, I wanted to then add my CSS styling to the web application
- and lastly, deployment.

## MVP

- Full CRUD functionality
- Consistent Github commits per day of working
- Deployed online via HEROKU
- Git Repo not in the classroom repository
- Include complete README

## STRETCH GOALS

- Implement restrictions on specific groups (account management). Currently as it stands, all users can see all events.
- Transpose the event data points onto a calendar flex-box container. This container would change views depending on the chosen month for events.
- Implement more CSS elements to enhance the user experience.

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS / Issues

- Due to the complex nature of my schema and use of HBS.
- I wanted to implement a more interactive navigation bar, which could improve the UX/UI.
- I ran into issues with connecting my HBS views files to my styles.css folder. Through various attempts I was unable to connect this. Unfortunately, this took up most my time where I could've spent more time developing the CSS/UI for this project.
- Clearly my live app does not reflect my goals depicted in my wireframes, and wanted to incorporate more
